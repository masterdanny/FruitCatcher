## Project Overview

This project is a simple, web-based game called "Fruit Catcher". The objective of the game is to catch falling fruit in a basket. The game is implemented entirely in a single `index.html` file, using HTML5 Canvas for rendering and plain JavaScript for the game logic.

## Building and Running

### Running the Game

There is no build process required to run this game. Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

### How to Play

- **Desktop:** Use the **left and right arrow keys** to move the basket.
- **Mobile:** Touch the **left or right side of the screen** to move the basket in that direction.

The game ends when a fruit hits the ground. A "Restart Game" button will appear to allow you to play again.

## Development Conventions

The project is self-contained within the `index.html` file and does not use any external libraries or frameworks. The code follows standard JavaScript and HTML5 practices. All the game's logic, including rendering, input handling, and game state management, is handled by the JavaScript code within the `<script>` tag.
